# DaNES

[DanTup](https://github.com/DanTup/)'s attempt to make a NES emulator in C#.

This is entirely a learning excercise so it is very unlikely to produce a stable polished emulator anytime soon (if ever). If you're looking for something to play NES games, this probably isn't it!

I've never done this before, so it will probably be rather messy as I learn! PRs that improve the code will be considered as long as I can completely understand the new code and they are not enourmous chunks of implementation that I might wish to build myself.
